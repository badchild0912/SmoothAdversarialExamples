# Smooth Adversarial Examples

![smooth](readme/smooth.png)

This code is for the paper [Smooth Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.11862.pdf)

## Latest Updates

The original code is built based on the TensorFlow. The attack method are implemented in attacks_SAE.py and attacks_tf_SAE.py

The Laplacian graph is generated by MATALAB codes. These codes are under folder 'matlabGenerate', which show how to generate graphs for the smooth attack.

The codes for magnification are under the folder 'magnify'.

We are trying to translate the MATALAB codes for generating Laplacian graph into python codes, and make the framework more unify. These codes are under folder 'SAE'. It is still under debuging.

## Run the code
1. Install dependencies.

2. Run the experiments on ImageNet.
```bash
cd wholeExperiments
python inc_scw.py
